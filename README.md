# Pan_card_tampering
The purpose of this project is to detect tampering of PAN card using computer vision. This project will help different organization in detecting whether the Id i.e. the PAN card provided to them by thier employees or customers or anyone is original or not.
For this project I calculated structural similarity of original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by a user.
This project can be used in different organizations where customers or users need to provide any kind of id in order to get themselves verified. The organization can use this project to find out whether the ID is original or fake. Similarly this can be used for any type of ID like adhar, voter id, etc.
